# PiVT

## Raspberry Pi VT220 emulator

This project started off as a fork of https://github.com/scott5/pigfx
with the intent to carry over bug fixes from Filippo Bergamasco's
original version and make it emulate a Digital Equipment VT220
terminal.  In the process, all of the code from pigfx has been removed
and the system was rewritten in C++ using
[libvterm](https://github.com/neovim/libvterm) and
[circle](https://github.com/smuehlst/circle-stdlib).

This emulator tries to faithfully render the VT220 font which requires
10 by 20 pixels for each character.  See
https://vt100.net/dec/vt220/glyphs for a description of how that
works.

## Prerequisites

Currently, this project has been tested on Raspberry Pi Zero (without
WiFi).  It should work on other models as the hardware is accessed
through the [circle](https://github.com/smuehlst/circle-stdlib)
library.

Depending on what you want your terminal to talk to, you may need an
RS232 level converter connected to the Pi's serial port.

## Installation

Copy the files from the bin/ subdirectory to a SD card formatted with
FAT32 and boot that in your Raspberry Pi.
